    <h1>Water Filtration part of Hybrid System for Great Little Water Company</h1>
    <p>
        The hybrid system used by GLWC encourages efficiency and optimises heat transfer within the building's cooling system. 
        <br>
        This is because the system reduces scaling, removes existing scale, reduces fouling and removes sludges and suspended solids.

    <h3>What?</h3>
    
       <ul>
        <li>I was tasked to create a 3D Model of the existing water filtration section of the hybrid System.</li>
        <li>I was also tasked with creating a flow simulation to show how water flows through the filtration system. </li>
       </ul>

    <h3>How?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Each part was designed and assembled in Solidworks.</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Using the Flow Simulation plug in, the water flow was demonstrated.</li>
    </ul>
